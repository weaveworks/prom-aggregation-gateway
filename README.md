# Prometheus Aggregation Gateway

Prometheus Aggregation Gateway is a aggregating push gateway for Prometheus.  As opposed to the official [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway), this service aggregates the sample values it receives.

* Counters where all labels match are added up.
* Histograms are added up; if bucket boundaries are mismatched then the result has the union of all buckets and counts are given to the lowest bucket that fits.
* Gauges are also added up (but this may not make any sense)
* Summaries are discarded.

## How to use

Create a yaml configuration file and add the port, e.g:

```
port: 8084
```

To run with the configuration file add the argument [-config]

Send metrics in [Prometheus format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/) to `/metrics/`

E.g. if you have the program running locally:

```bash
echo 'http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027' | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost/metrics/
```

Now you can push your metrics using your favorite Prometheus client.

E.g. in Python using [prometheus/client_python](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python):

```python
from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Counter, push_to_gateway
registry = CollectorRegistry()
counter = Counter('some_counter', "A counter", registry=registry)
counter.inc()
push_to_gateway('localhost', job='my_job_name', registry=registry)
```

Then have your Prometheus scrape metrics at `/metrics`.

## Comparison to [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway)

According to https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/:

> The Pushgateway never forgets series pushed to it and will expose them to Prometheus forever...
>
> The latter point is especially relevant when multiple instances of a job differentiate their metrics in the Pushgateway via an instance label or similar.

This restriction makes the Prometheus pushgateway inappropriate for the usecase of accepting metrics from a client-side web app, so we created this one to aggregate counters from multiple senders.

Prom-aggregation-gateway presents a similar API, but does not attempt to be a drop-in replacement.

## JS Client Library

See https://github.com/weaveworks/promjs/ for a JS client library for Prometheus that can be used from within a web app.
